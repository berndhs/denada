For the Arado project we have some Coding Conventions.

There are only a few, so Pay Attention Please.

- Indenting
 
  Indenting is by 2 (two) spaces. No tab characters, never.

- Brackets

  Brackets (these { } ) are on a new line for functions and classes,
  and trailing on the same line for if, while, switch.

- Optional Brackets

  Compound statements are enclosed in { } brackets, even when
  the compound statement is only one line:

  if (foo) {
    barFunction();
  ]

- Names

  Names are in Camel Case, like TheFunctionName
  not all lower case like thewrongfunctionname

  Make names meaningful if possible, but not too long. 
  
- Spacing

  For control structues (if, while, for) put a space behing the keyword,
  like

     if (this != that) {
       DoSomething (this, that);
     }

- Line Length

  Keep lines to 80 characters or less when possible. It is almost always 
  possible.

- IDE specific formating

  If your IDE does not support these convention, get another IDE. Or file a 
  bug report for your IDE provider. They have no business telling other 
  people how to write their code.
